#### 1. How Polymorphism is implemented?
> * Vtable : table of function pointers is maintained per class
> * Vptr : pointer to this table is maintained per object
> * So call is made to the function corresponding to object type.

#### Abstraction, Inheritance , Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Overloading
* <strong> Abstraction :- </strong> To represent the essential feature without representing the back ground details. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. Abstraction provides you a generalized view of your classes or object by providing relevant information. Abstraction is the process of hiding the working style of an object, and showing the information of an object in understandable manner.
* <strong> Encapsulation :- </strong> Wrapping up data member and method together into a single unit (i.e. Class) is called Encapsulation.
* <strong> Inheritance </strong> is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.
* <strong> Polymorphism </strong> means one name many forms. One function behaves different forms. In other words, "Many forms of a single object is called Polymorphism." Two types of Polymorphism <strong> static & dynamic </strong> Overloading is static Polymorphism while overriding is dynamic Polymorphism.
