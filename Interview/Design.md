#### Implementing NewsFeed
> * <strong> Data model:- </strong>  We need some schema to store user and feed object. More importantly, there are lots of trade-offs when we try to optimize the system on read/write. Modelling User-feed and user-friend data.
> * <strong> Feed ranking :- </strong> Affinity, Edge Weight, Time decay
> * <strong>Feed publishing:- </strong>  <em>PULL and PUSH</em> . Publishing can be trivial when there’re only few hundreds of users. But it can be costly when there are millions or even billions of users. So there’s a scale problem here.
